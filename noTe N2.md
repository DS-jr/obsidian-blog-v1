   **If you make a decision, would you be comfortable if everyone knows you made it?**  
   Can you **make this decision w/ full transparency & feel you’ll NOT have to hide anything**?

- (Paul Graham)  Working hard means constantly aiming towards the core important center of the problem / task == usually the most difficult / uncomfortable part of it. 

- (Rumi)  “As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears.”

- (Ray Dalio) ==Become an IMperfectionist==. Perfectionists spend too much time on little differences at the expense of the important things.
